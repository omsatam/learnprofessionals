        <h2>Bored of this education system</h2>
        <h5>Education does not teach children how to develop their capacity to think logically so that they can reach to
            their own conclusions when presented with information.... Hence their critical thinking is prevented from
            improving, and as a result children are turned into stupid automatons.</h5>

            <p>I really liked the way learn professional experts teaches skills.before this Everyone is telling me that
                you don't have any general knowledge about world. So i searched various sites and find this site. I like
                the way <b>Ajay sir</b> explaining about political science and government issues with so much interest,
                I doesn't feel bored at all. i also loved the way <b>Neha ma'am</b> teaching different important article
                of constitution especially reservation. Now i am so confident.thanks to learn professional for teaching
                boring political science so effectively. </p>

                I wanted to be creative. so i joined this, Here i met experts like <b>Swapnil sir</b> .He is always
                excited in doing anything. Swapnil sir know everything from sketching, dancing and lot of other skills.
                I never feel like if I'm in any coaching environment with him. Also i like to mention about gauri ma'am.

            <p>I am always little bit scared ,i wanted to improve my public speaking and talk freely. and luckily i
                found this site. Here the experts are well qualified. I like the way <b>Ruksa ma'am</b> teaches about
                confidence building, fearless attitude. She helped me alot and tought me how to overcome fear. And also
