        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <div class="Creativity">
            <img src="Img/creativity.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
                creativity involves transforming your ideas, imagination, and dreams into reality. When you’re being
                creative, you can see the hidden patterns, make connections between things that aren’t normally related,
                and come up with a solution. Creativity is the ability to think about a task or a problem in a new or
                different way, or the ability to use the imagination to generate new ideas. Creativity enables you to
                solve complex problems or find interesting ways to approach tasks. If you are creative, you look at
                things from a unique perspective.<br />Creativity helps you see things differently and better deal with
                uncertainty. Studies show that creative people are better able to live with uncertainty because they can
                adapt their thinking to allow for the flow of the unknown.

        <h3>Political Science</h3>
        <div class="political-science">
            <img src="Img/political-science.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
                Political science is the systematic study of the state, nation, government and its public policies. It
                deals with the theory and practices of politics and analyses the political systems, processes and
                behaviour. It is also concerned in addressing some of the core problems faced by the society at large
                such as in achieving world peace or at a more national level, how to achieve and sustain economic growth
                and stability.</p>
            <h5>Why is political science important?</h5>
            <p>Political science is important because political science is about people. It doesn’t just concerned only
                the government or the political group who is ruling a particular state or country but every citizen and
                every man on the street. This is because politics impacts our lives, both directly and indirectly,
                whether we’re aware of it or not. “To ignore politics, and not get involved in politics would seem
                rather silly considering that your life is dictated by it.”

        <h3>Stress Management</h3>
        <div class="stress-management">
            <img src="Img/stress-management.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
                Stress management is a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's
                level of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of and for the motive of improving
                everyday functioning.<br />
                Effective stress management helps you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier,
                healthier, and more productive. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships,
                relaxation, and fun—and the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on.
